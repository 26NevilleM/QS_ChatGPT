# Research Probe â€” Minimal

Objective: List Phase 1 deliverables, owners, and dates from our kick-off docs.
Sources: - Kick-off notes (internal): section 'Scope & Deliverables'
- Email summary thread (internal): timeline + owners
Constraints: Only include items you can justify from the sources. Put maybes in uncertainties.

Please extract and return data conforming to this schema:
{
  "deliverables": [{"title":"","owner":"","due":""}],
  "risks": [""],
  "open_questions": [""],
  "uncertainties": ""
}

Instructions:
- Read the sources. If sources are just notes/URLs, use them as input text.
- Summarize concisely, adhere to the schema keys exactly.
- When uncertain, include a short "uncertainties" note.
