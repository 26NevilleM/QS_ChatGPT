Stripe generally offers competitive fees starting at 1.4% + €0.25 for European cards, with a straightforward fee structure. Payouts are typically faster, occurring within 2-7 days, with robust foreign exchange support and easy-to-use dispute tooling. Adyen, while potentially offering lower rates for high volumes, involves more complex implementation; payout timings vary but can be longer, and its advanced dispute management tools may benefit larger operations. Both platforms support multi-currency processing, but Stripe’s user-friendly rollout may appeal more to smaller SaaS businesses.
