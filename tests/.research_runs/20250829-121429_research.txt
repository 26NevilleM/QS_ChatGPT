The sanity check after an outfile guard involves validating the integrity and correctness of data written to output files to ensure that they meet expected formats and constraints. This process includes verifying file sizes, checking for any data corruption, and confirming that all necessary information has been accurately reflected in the output, preventing unintended errors in data processing or storage. Implementing robust sanity checks helps enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of the output generated by applications.
