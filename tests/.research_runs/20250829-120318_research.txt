Budget guardrails define the parameters for government spending, ensuring that expenditures align with strategic priorities while maintaining fiscal responsibility. They focus on areas of investment that can stimulate growth and improve services, while clearly outlining sectors where funding will be restricted or reduced. These guidelines help maintain financial stability and accountability in the budgeting process.
