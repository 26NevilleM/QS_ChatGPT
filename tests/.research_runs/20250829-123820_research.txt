Moving from AWS RDS Postgres to Aurora Postgres for a write-heavy workload offers advantages like improved availability and performance with automatic failover and read scaling, but it may come with increased costs due to the pricing model and additional features. Aurora's storage autoscaling can efficiently manage spikes in demand, but users should be aware of limits on write throughput and possible latency due to multi-master setups. Ultimately, while Aurora can enhance performance and scalability, careful consideration of costs and operational limits is essential.
