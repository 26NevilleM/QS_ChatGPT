Post-guard sanity checks are evaluations performed after implementing security measures to ensure that the defenses are effective and that potential vulnerabilities remain addressed. This process involves reviewing logs, monitoring system behavior, and testing for potential breaches or weaknesses in security protocols. Regular sanity checks are crucial for maintaining system integrity and enhancing overall cybersecurity resilience.
