Stripe generally offers transparent pricing with per-transaction fees around 1.4% + €0.25 for EU cards, while Adyen’s fees can vary based on volume and negotiation but may be around 0.6-1.0% + €0.10 for similar transactions. Payout latencies are typically one business day for Stripe and can vary based on the bank for Adyen; both provide foreign exchange (FX) services with competitive rates. Dispute tooling is robust in both platforms, with Stripe offering comprehensive insights and Adyen providing an advanced dispute management system; however, Stripe is often seen as easier to roll out for smaller SaaS businesses due to its straightforward integration compared to Adyen’s more complex setup.
