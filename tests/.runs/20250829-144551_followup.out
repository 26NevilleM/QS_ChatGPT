Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. Comparison request: Which vendor is better for orthopedic screw machining — Supplier A (local) vs Supplier B (overseas)? Consider cost, lead time, quality certifications, and supply reliability.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
