Hi Taylor,

It’s been 9 day(s) since we last connected. 1. **Competitor A**  
   - **Pros:** Strong brand recognition and extensive distribution network.  
   - **Cons:** Higher price point may deter cost-sensitive customers.

2. **Competitor B**  
   - **Pros:** Innovative product features and user-friendly design.  
   - **Cons:** Limited customer support options compared to competitors.

3. **Competitor C**  
   - **Pros:** Affordable pricing and a wide range of product options.  
   - **Cons:** Lower perceived quality and a less established reputation.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
