Hi Jordan,

It’s been 2 day(s) since we last connected. Build vs buy for support chat (15 agents): Zendesk vs Intercom. Compare SLAs, workflow flexibility, reporting depth, rollout effort, total cost.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
