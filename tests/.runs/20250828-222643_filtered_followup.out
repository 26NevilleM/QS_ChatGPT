Hi Sam,

Just checking in to keep things rolling and see what feels good for next steps.
From my side: Happy to send a one-pager if helpful.

Happy to share a quick summary or jump on a brief call—whatever’s easiest.
No pressure—I just want to make it easy to proceed whenever you’re ready.

Cheers,
Neville
