Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. 1. Clearly outline project objectives, timelines, and expected outcomes to ensure alignment with the sponsor's vision.
2. Highlight key stakeholder roles and how their engagement will contribute to project success.
3. Present a summary of potential risks, mitigation strategies, and how the sponsor can support the project to address these challenges.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
