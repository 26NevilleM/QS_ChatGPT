Hi Alex,

Just a quick note to keep things moving and check in on next steps.
From my side: DIRECT: Confirming status and proposing a short call to lock the next step and timeline.

If helpful, I can clarify anything or suggest a short path forward.
No pressure—I just want to make it easy to proceed whenever you’re ready.

Best,
Neville
