Hi Taylor,

It’s been 10 day(s) since we last connected. The Phase 1 scope focuses on defining project objectives, key deliverables, and establishing a timeline for initial activities. Near-term decision points include prioritizing tasks, allocating resources, and determining stakeholder engagement strategies to ensure successful project initiation and alignment with overall goals.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
