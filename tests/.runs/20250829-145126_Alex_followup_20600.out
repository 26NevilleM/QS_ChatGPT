Hi Alex,

It’s been 3 day(s) since we last connected. SOC2-ready logging pipeline for 10 services: Datadog vs New Relic vs OpenTelemetry + Loki — cost, lock-in, oncall noise.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
