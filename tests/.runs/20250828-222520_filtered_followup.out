Hi Jordan,

I hope this finds you well. I’m writing to follow up and confirm next steps.
From my side: Checking whether the updated figures made sense.

If convenient, I can provide a concise summary or address any questions you may have.
No pressure—I just want to make it easy to proceed whenever you’re ready.

Kind regards,
Neville
