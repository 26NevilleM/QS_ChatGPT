Hi Taylor,

It’s been 9 day(s) since we last connected. The two biggest unknowns in research typically involve identifying gaps in current knowledge and understanding potential implications of findings. Immediate unblockers often include securing funding and resources, as well as fostering collaboration between interdisciplinary teams to address these gaps effectively.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
