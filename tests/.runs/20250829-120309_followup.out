Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. The two biggest unknowns in risk management often include unforeseen external factors (e.g., economic shifts, natural disasters) and technological disruptions (e.g., cyber threats). Mitigation options involve developing robust contingency plans, diversifying investments, and investing in advanced technologies to enhance resilience and adaptability. Additionally, regular risk assessments and stakeholder engagement can further strengthen risk management strategies.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
