Hi Taylor,

It’s been 9 day(s) since we last connected. Phase 1 focuses on defining the project's scope and identifying immediate decision points that will guide subsequent phases. Key considerations include resource allocation, stakeholder engagement, and potential risks that may impact project timelines. Clear documentation and consensus on these elements will be critical for ensuring a successful progression.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
