Hi Taylor,

It’s been 9 day(s) since we last connected. The two biggest unknowns in risk review are unforeseen external events, such as natural disasters or economic downturns, and technological failures, which can disrupt operations. Mitigation options include developing contingency plans, diversifying supply chains, investing in technology redundancy, and continually monitoring potential risk factors to adapt proactively.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
