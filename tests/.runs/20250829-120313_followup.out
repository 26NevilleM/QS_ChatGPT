Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. The research focuses on optimizing project timelines to ensure a rapid yet feasible product launch. It emphasizes identifying critical milestones and resource allocation strategies that streamline development processes while maintaining quality and market readiness. The goal is to balance speed with practicality to achieve timely market entry.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
