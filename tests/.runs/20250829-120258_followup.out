Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. Phase 1 scope focuses on initial project objectives, deliverables, and timelines, aiming to establish a solid foundation for future phases. Near-term decision points include assessing resource allocation, evaluating initial findings, and determining necessary adjustments to ensure alignment with overall goals.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
