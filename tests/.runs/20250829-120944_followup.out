Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. A quick viability scan for a Phase 1 launch path assesses market demand, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements, and resource availability to determine the feasibility of the project. It focuses on key indicators such as target audience engagement, potential partnerships, and cost-benefit analysis to inform decision-making and strategic planning. This evaluation helps streamline development efforts and reduce risks associated with the initial launch phase.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
