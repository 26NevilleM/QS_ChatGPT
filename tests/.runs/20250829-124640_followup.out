Dear Jordan,

From my side: When comparing Zendesk and Intercom for a 15-agent support chat solution, Zendesk typically offers more robust SLAs and greater reporting depth, which is beneficial for detailed analytics.

It’s been 5 day(s) since we last connected. Just a quick ping to keep things moving.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side.

Kind regards,
Neville
