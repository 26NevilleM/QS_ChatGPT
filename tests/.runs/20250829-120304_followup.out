Hi Jordan,

It’s been 4 day(s) since we last connected. 1. **Competitor A**: Pros - Established market presence and strong brand loyalty; Cons - Higher price point may deter budget-conscious consumers.  
2. **Competitor B**: Pros - Innovative features attract tech-savvy users; Cons - Reliability issues raise concerns among potential customers.  
3. **Competitor C**: Pros - Affordable pricing and value for money; Cons - Limited features can deter users seeking premium options.  

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
