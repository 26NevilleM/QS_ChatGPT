Hi Taylor,

It’s been 9 day(s) since we last connected. 1. Project Objectives: Clearly outline the goals and expected outcomes of the project, emphasizing how they align with the sponsor's interests and organizational priorities.  
2. Budget and Timeline: Provide a concise overview of the estimated budget, key milestones, and delivery timelines to ensure transparency and accountability.  
3. Risk Management: Highlight potential risks and mitigation strategies to reassure the sponsor that challenges will be addressed proactively.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
