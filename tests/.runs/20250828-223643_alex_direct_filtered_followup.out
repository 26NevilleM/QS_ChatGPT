Hi Jamie,  
I hope you’re doing well. It’s been a few days since our pricing call and I just wanted to check in. Did you have a chance to review the details? If you’d like, we can set up another time to go through any questions. No rush if you’re still considering. Looking forward to your thoughts.  
Best,  
Neville

Best,
Neville
