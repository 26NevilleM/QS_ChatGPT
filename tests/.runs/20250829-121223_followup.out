Hi Jordan,

It’s been 5 day(s) since we last connected. A sanity check after an outfile guard ensures that data written to a file meets specific expectations, such as format and integrity, before being finalized. This process helps prevent errors and corruption in files resulting from unexpected outcomes in the writing process. Implementing such checks can enhance the reliability and quality of file outputs in various applications.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
