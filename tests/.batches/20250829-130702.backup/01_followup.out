Hi Jordan,

From my side: When comparing Zendesk and Intercom for a 15-agent support chat solution, Zendesk typically offers more robust SLAs and greater reporting depth, which is beneficial for detailed analytics. Intercom provides superior work…


It’s been 5 day(s) since we last connected. Build vs buy for support chat (15 agents): Zendesk vs Intercom. Compare SLAs, workflow flexibility, reporting depth, rollout effort, and total cost.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
