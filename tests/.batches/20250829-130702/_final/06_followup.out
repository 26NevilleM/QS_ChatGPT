Hi Jordan,

From my side: Email warmup practices for a new domain sending 100–300/day; ramp plan, DNS/auth (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), reputation monitoring; tools trade-offs.

It’s been 5 day(s) since we last connected.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
