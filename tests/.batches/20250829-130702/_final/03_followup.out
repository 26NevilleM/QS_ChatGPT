Hi Jordan,

From my side: Summarize the two leading options for AI meeting notes (Fireflies vs Fathom) for a 12-seat team; accuracy, CRM sync quality, pricing gotchas.

It’s been 5 day(s) since we last connected.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
