It’s been 5 day(s) since we last connected. Best lightweight analytics for a small B2B SaaS (under 5k MAU): PostHog vs Plausible vs GA4; privacy, funnels, self-host vs cloud.

If helpful, I can share a brief next step or answer any questions — whatever’s easiest on your side. No rush.

Best,
Neville
