## Quick Start (TL;DR)

From the repo root:

```bash
# One-time bootstrap (installs pre-commit hook, backfills prompts, validates)
./scripts/one-shot-setup

# Optional flags
./scripts/one-shot-setup --push   # also commit & push changes
./scripts/one-shot-setup --force  # overwrite existing template/CI/Makefile if applicable

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-change

# Edit prompts / tools
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: my change"   # pre-commit will run fix+validate
git push
After pasting, make sure `EOF` is on its **own line**, then press Enter. Youâ€™ll be back at the `%` prompt.

Now verify and commit:

```bash
wc -l CONTRIBUTING.md
sed -n '1,60p' CONTRIBUTING.md

git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md with Quick Start guide"
git push
